Rendering
=========================================

A series about understanding Unity's default rendering pipeline. 
How a mesh turns into pixels that look like real objects. 
Note that this covers the built-in legacy pipeline, which is on its way out. 
The concepts and techniques are still useful to know, but the specific approaches can be considered deprecated.
